# VBA Delivery Path Simulation
This group project is designed to generate a delivery path and run the simulation for the bakery staff.  Every time a staff process the order, the application will create a delivery path based on the Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (NNH) Model.

The NNH Model works in this way: Starting from the bakery, it determines the nearest delivery point and calculates the delivery time. If the delivery time does not exceed the customer's expected time, it identifies its nearest neighbour. The model repeats this process until the delivery time exceeds the expected time.

The staff can also run the simulation to determine the distribution of on-time delivery percentage, delivery time, and cost based on the randomly generated order. The staff can control the simulation by changing the relevant input in the simulation input sheet.
Moreover, It includes the Record Management system to manage the customer, product, and order info. Also, it includes generating the weekly delivery schedule and historical reports based on historical orders.
